## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Probably the biggest challenge in working on this project was the addition of the stars in the ratings section of the website.  Since we were provided only one image of a star, I had duplicated it 5 times in the HTML, and manipulated the margins of its parent container to render it properly (on both the desktop and mobile versions.  The code snippets created to demonstrate this are:


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources


- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2949606/repeat-css-background-image-a-set-number-of-times) - The aforementioned subject of repeating background stars was addressed by this question and answer in Stack Overflow.  It was incredibly useful in designing this project.
